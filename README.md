## Features

- **Mnemonic Seed Phrase Generation**: Create secure and random seed phrases for your crypto wallets.
- **Wallet Recovery**: Recover lost wallets using mnemonic phrases.
- **Balance Checking**: Check balances for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin.
- **Brute Force Capabilities**: Attempt to recover lost wallets using brute force methods.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eduardofaculdadejkk/seed-phrase-generator.git
cd seed-phrase-generator
```

After cloning the repository, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/eduardofaculdadejkk/seed-phrase-generator/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can start using it to generate seed phrases and recover wallets. The command-line interface is user-friendly and guides you through the process. 

To generate a seed phrase, run:

```bash
./seed_phrase_generator
```

Follow the prompts to create a new seed phrase. If you want to recover a wallet, simply provide the necessary details when prompted.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

This tool supports the following cryptocurrencies:

- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Binance Coin (BNB)**

You can check balances for these cryptocurrencies using the application. Simply input your wallet address, and the tool will retrieve the balance for you.

## How It Works

The Seed Phrase Generator uses a combination of cryptographic algorithms to ensure the security and randomness of the generated seed phrases. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it operates:

1. **Seed Phrase Generation**: The application generates a seed phrase based on the BIP39 standard, ensuring that it is both secure and compatible with most wallets.
2. **Brute Force Recovery**: For users who have lost access to their wallets, the application can attempt to brute force the seed phrase. This process may take time depending on the complexity of the original phrase.
3. **Balance Checking**: By connecting to blockchain APIs, the application can fetch real-time balance data for the specified wallet addresses.
